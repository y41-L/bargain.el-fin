            <li class="lists">Be careful and talk in private</li>
            <p class="explain">DON'T start bargaining with a salesperson in front of others. If they overheard that you're getting a deal, they'll want one too. The salesperson will likely to <mark class="highlight">turn you down</mark> if they know they will be going to
                give that same deal to other customers.</p>

            <li class="lists">Be friendly</li>
            <p class="explain">Salesperson will respond better to a <mark class="highlight">friendly customer</mark> than a demanding customer. Show them that you're willing to work with them.</p>

            <li class="lists">Give them a reason to bargain with you</li>
            <p class="explain">If you're at a repair shop, tell them that you will try to support their business. Merchants will be likely to offer a better price if they have a <mark class="highlight">reason</mark> to.</p>

            <li class="lists">Ask open ended questions</li>
            <p class="explain">DON'T make it easy for salesperson to tell you no, give them the opporunity to elaborate, <mark class="highlight">not cut you off</mark>.</p>

            <li class="lists">Show that you're smart</li>
            <p class="explain">Chances are, if the salesperson know you're an <mark class="highlight">educated consumer</mark>, they'll be more likely to work with you.</p>

            <li class="lists">Do your homework</li>
            <p class="explain">You should do some research beforehand. That way you know the <mark class="highlight">fair price to ask</mark> and avoid asking for a price way too low.</p>

            <li class="lists">Use silence</li>
            <p class="explain">Slience in a conversation can be awkward. If you resist the urge to fill it, the salesperson might just say <mark class="highlight">yes to
to you offer</mark> to avoid the silence.</p>

            <li class="lists">Seek for a cash discount</li>
            <p class="explain">Merchants have to pay fees when you use credit card to pay. They can avoid it if you pay in cash.</p>

            <li class="lists">Bargain at clearance</li>
            <p class="explain">Salesperson will be more likely to bargain with you if they're going to sell their merchandise. Let the salesperson know that you can get a <mark class="highlight">better deal else where</mark>.</p>

            <li class="lists">The first one to say the price loses</li>
            <p class="explain">If it's the seller, it will mean that you won't pay more than that price. If it's the buyer, the seller won't sell the product less than that price. Let the <mark class="highlight">seller set the price first</mark> and wait untill it drop
                before you suggest a price.</p>

            <li class="lists">Don't show ethusiasm for what you're looking at</li>
            <p class="explain">As soon as the salesperson know you like something, they have the upper hand.</p>

            <li class="lists">Get someone to work with you</li>
            <p class="explain">Have a friend with you when you bargain. If they pretend to be bored or in a hurry, the salesperson might cut straight to the chase and accept your offer.</p>

            <li class="lists">Don't be afraid to walk away</li>
            <p class="explain">As soon as you walk away, the seller lose a deal and they hate it. This might pressure the seller to offer you their lowest price. If they take the bait, make sure to counteroffer at a low price, or else it it higher than their lowest and
                price and they accepted it.</p>

            <li class="lists">Buy their empathy</li>
            <p class="explain">Kids get what they want most of the time because people feel sorry for them. If you can make them feel sorry for you, they will offer you a lower price.</p>

            <li class="lists">Know when to stop</li>
            <p class="explain">DON'T push it, or you'll ruin the whole deal. Be please with what you get.</p>

            <li class="lists">Don't let them anchor you with the first price</li>
            <p class="explain">Anchoring is when your judgement revolve around the initial price. Always do your research before getting rip off by merchants.</p>

            <li class="lists">Keep a maximum price in mind</li>
            <p class="explain">If you don't, you will be too attached to the process and accept the deal on impulse.</p>

            <li class="lists">Go around shops and compare the price of the same good</li>
            <p class="explain">You can always come back and buy the good. Once you go around, you will have a good baseline price and feel confident that you will get a good deal.</p>

            <li class="lists">Personal insult and threats</li>
            <p class="explain">People are hard to work with. Personal insult can make you insecure and vulnerable. DON'T take the bait, the seller is trying to get you off the deal. Take a break and identify the motives. If it's your cause, apologize. If you are confused,
                ask. If all fail, restate your's and their's interest and try work out a deal. Don't be afraid to walk away.</p>

            <li class="lists">Be ready to spend a lot of time and energy to bargain</li>

Conclusion:
        In life, you rarely get anything you don’t ask for. If you want something, 
        you’d better do your part to get it. If you ask nicely, and you ask 
        fairly, most people will go a long way to meet you in the middle.
